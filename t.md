Here's my advice:

Act 1 - I prefer using the original title of the paper (There is no Fork: an Abstraction for Efficient, Concurrent, and Concise Data Access) as the title of the slides, and use the authors' names (Simon Marlow, Louis Brandy, Jonathan Coens, Jon Purdy) as the subtitle, which is actually the existing content in the slides.md file.

I think we can have part which concludes what Haxl is about first.

I appreciate you involving Spark or other data engineering technologies in the slides, but I think it's not necessary because I can't explain them well because of my limited knowledge.

Good job for the emojis, but maybe we don't need to keep them in the slides since I hope the content of the slides is always concise and not too verbose. We can, however, keep them in the notes section of the slides.

I think Act 3 is a bit too long and I really doubt if I can explain so many Haskell stuff well and our team members can stay focused. Maybe we can simplify it and only keep the core ideas.

BTW I think the structure of the Haxl talk is a good reference.
